scrolling the intro cutscene
painting the ship to match level 1 cutscene
better play 'action' button visual
fix starfield starting too far to the right
fix starfield 'speed view' should be logarithmic (try speed mod being log instead of linear)
level 2 cutscene speed up frame rate of solar part (or all?)

done?
